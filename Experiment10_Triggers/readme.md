# Experiment 10: PL/SQL – Triggers
## NAME: UDHAYA PRAKASH V
## REG NO: 2122242400
## AIM
To write and execute PL/SQL trigger programs for automating actions in response to specific table events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

---

## THEORY

A **trigger** is a stored PL/SQL block that is automatically executed or fired when a specified event occurs on a table or view. Triggers can be used for enforcing business rules, auditing changes, or automatic updates.

### Types of Triggers:
- **Before Trigger**: Executes before the operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **After Trigger**: Executes after the operation.
- **Row-level Trigger**: Executes for each affected row.
- **Statement-level Trigger**: Executes once for the triggering statement.

**Basic Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE|AFTER INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
   -- trigger logic
END;
```

## 1. Write a trigger to log every insertion into a table.

## PROGRAM
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_log (emp_id, name, position, salary)
    VALUES (:NEW.emp_id, :NEW.name, :NEW.position, :NEW.salary);
END;
/
SELECT table_name FROM user_tables WHERE table_name IN ('EMPLOYEES', 'EMPLOYEE_LOG');
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    position VARCHAR2(100),
    salary NUMBER(10, 2)
);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
